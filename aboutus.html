     <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2010, Fictional Co. began as a small startup in a shared coworking space with a team of just three passionate individuals. The original goal was to create simple software tools to help local businesses automate their operations.</p>
      <p>In 2013, we launched our first successful product — a cloud-based scheduling platform — which quickly gained traction and attracted our first round of angel investors. This marked a turning point, allowing us to expand our team and move into our first dedicated office space.</p>
      <p>Over the next few years, we diversified our product offerings, embracing mobile-first technologies, AI integration, and design thinking principles. By 2017, Fictional Co. had grown into a mid-sized company with clients across North America and Europe.</p>
      <p>In 2020, during the global pandemic, we shifted to a fully remote work model, which not only ensured business continuity but also expanded our talent pool to a global level. We embraced digital transformation internally and helped hundreds of our clients do the same.</p>
      <p>Today, Fictional Co. is a recognized name in the tech industry, known for innovation, inclusivity, and putting people first. Our journey is ongoing, and we continue to evolve with the same passion and purpose that sparked our beginning.</p>
